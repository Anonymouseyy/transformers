# Transformers

Fun little project I made to experiment with GPTs and code one. Understand most of the concepts related with basic GPTs now. Thanks to this [FCC tutorial](https://youtu.be/UU1WVnMk4E8?si=7qk-IeX0AlQHGkyM) for the first time. Karpathy's for second [here](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=EkfH9XfUDd-AKlRN). I would say Karpathy's lecture was better but maybe I just had more understanding going into it.

## Using the first

Start with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use `gpt-v1.ipynb` to work with hyperparameters and train them using the code block marked with `# Training`. Train and adjust model and hyperparameters however you want with a reasonably sized corpus named `x.txt` in the same directory.

Run `main.py` to speak with your new LLM :)

## Using the second

Run the Jupyter Notebook in the karpathy folder.
